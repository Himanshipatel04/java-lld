Decorator Pattern

Suppose we are playing a video game where a character can have different abilities.
We can use the Decorator Pattern to add abilities to our character dynamically.

Why we can't use inheritance?
- Inheritance creates a rigid structure. If we want to add or remove abilities, we would
    need to create a new subclass for each combination of abilities.
- This leads to a combinatorial explosion of classes and makes the code hard to maintain.
- The Decorator Pattern allows us to add or remove abilities at runtime without modifying
    the original class or creating a new subclass.
- It promotes composition over inheritance, making the code more flexible and easier to maintain.

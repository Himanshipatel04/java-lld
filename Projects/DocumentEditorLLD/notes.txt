to approach any lld problem we need to follow certain steps
1. understand the problem statement and requirements
2. identify the main entities and their relationships
3. define classes and their attributes and methods
4. implement the classes and methods



there are two approaches to do so
1. top-down approach
   - start with high-level design
   - break down into smaller components
   - define interactions between components
   - implement each component

2. bottom-up approach
    - start with low-level components
    - define classes and their attributes and methods
    - implement classes and methods
    - integrate components into larger system
both approaches have their own advantages and disadvantages

top-down approach is useful for complex systems where high-level design is important
bottom-up approach is useful for systems where low-level components are well-defined


ultimately the choice of approach depends on the specific problem and requirements at hand
both approaches can be combined to create a hybrid approach that leverages the strengths of both methods
regardless of the approach taken it is important to follow best practices such as modularity encapsulation and separation of concerns to ensure a maintainable and scalable design



for document editor if we appraoch using top-down approach we will first identify the main components such as main page and then sub components such as toolbar text area etc
then we will define the interactions between these components and implement each component

if we approach using bottom-up approach we will first define low-level components such as text area toolbar etc
then we will implement these components and integrate them into larger system such as main page
both approaches can be used to create a comprehensive design for the document editor

most of the times we should go for bottom-up approach as we have to define various components such as text area toolbar etc first and then integrate them into larger system such as main page
